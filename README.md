# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio – Joshua Oyewole

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!

This repo contains hands-on labs, projects, and documentation from my journey through the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** on Coursera and ongoing security skill development. Every project here is designed to show my ability to detect threats, secure systems, and work with real tools used by cybersecurity professionals.

I'm building this portfolio not just to practice, but to show proof of what I can do — step by step, from beginner concepts to advanced security operations.

## 📁 Lab Categories

###  `google-cybersecurity-labs/`
Labs completed during my Google Cybersecurity Certificate training.

- `file-permissions-lab/` – Reviewed and corrected Linux file and directory permissions using `chmod`
- `network-logs-lab/` *(coming soon)* – Captured and analyzed network logs using `tcpdump`
- `wireshark-packet-analysis/` *(coming soon)* – Used Wireshark to inspect protocol traffic and detect anomalies
- `incident-response-case-study/` *(coming soon)* – Walked through a simulated incident, documenting each response phase

### 🔐 `microsoft-security-labs/` *(coming soon)*
Labs that will be created from real-world Microsoft security tools after completing the SC-200 certification.

Planned:
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint threat detection lab
- Azure Sentinel alert rule and playbook demo
- KQL query-based threat hunting project
- Data loss prevention policy test in Microsoft Purview

---

### 🧰 `scripts-and-tools/`
Custom Bash and Python scripts are used to automate common security tasks or assist in analysis.
